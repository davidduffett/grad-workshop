## Exerices

1. In order to perform searches, your documents needs to be in an Elasticsearch index. Lets create one. For this workshop purpose, lets assume we are indexing job ads and a job has the following attributes.

* id - A unique identifier
* title - Title of the job ad
* description - The job description
* advertiser - Advertiser of the job ad
* publishedDate - Date the job ad was published
